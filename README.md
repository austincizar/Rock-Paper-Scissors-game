# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game.
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is played like this: the player selects a random option between Rock, Paper or Scissors, the computer then selects one random option as well from the three. The winner is decided depending on the options selected by both parties (a rock, paper, or scissors): A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. It's a tie if both the PC and the player selects the same option.
